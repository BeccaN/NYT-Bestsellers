# NYT Hardcover Bestsellers
### This is an adaptation of the original gem written by dannyd4315. I have added in CSS selectors in the restaurant.rb file, and updated the scraped urls to use https instead of http. 

This Ruby Gem provides a CLI to view the 50 best restaurants in the World as per the San Pellegrino sponsored 50 Best Restaurants in the World website.
